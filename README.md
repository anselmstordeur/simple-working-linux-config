# simple-working-linux-config

When I setup a new user on a linux system, i start googling my way to configure all sort of things. 
This repository should provide a simple and easy way to setup a new system. The config files should follow some simple rules:
* cross-system compatible 
  * Arch Linux
  * Debian
  * Ubuntu
* don't bother me
  * don't add fancy features that can bother me whithout further explaination
    (like adding shortcuts that can interfere my user-experience)
* well documented
  * further user-experience interfering feature can be outcommented and explained in further documentation
  * each file should be understandable without reading third-party documentation


#### Feel free to add your ideas and config files via pull request
